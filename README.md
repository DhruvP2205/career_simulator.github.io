# CAREER-PATH-SIMULATOR
A single-file terminal-style gamebook where players use only the keyboard to make numbered choices, navigating a branching narrative world. Entirely text-driven, with no external files, no CSS, and no internet. The challenge lies in fitting all game logic, story data, and input handling into one file, mimicking an old-school adventure terminal.
